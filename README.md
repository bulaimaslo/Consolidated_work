# Consolidated-work


## [Blockchain implementation]()  -  Currently

## [Recipes](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Recipes)  -  July 2021
Since I study Data Engineering not computer science I knew I lack some web development knowledge. To catch up I decided to make a web service based on Spring Boot which ended up being a service for handling, storing, deleting, retrieving and updating recipes.
Topics I learned before and during project:
 - Spring Boot
 - Gradle
 - REST API
 - H2 Database

## [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/tictactoe)  -  June 2021
After hard time with Python dependencies and ml libraries during previous project I decided to do some work with Java.
I had to revise basics but easily managed to make Tic-tac-toe console game which allows you to play with bots of 3 difficulties:
 - easy - makes random moves
 - medium - able to find winning move and to block opponent's winning move
 - hard - impossible to win against. With my implementation of the minimax algorithm.

## [NLP](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/NLP)  -  April/May 2021
The goal of this project was comparison of classic text representation methods (bag-of-words and n-grams) with vector representations of words obtained from deep models (word embeddings). Even though I failed to obtain satisfying results from machine learning models I was left with a good portion of knowledge from the nlp domain.
I abandoned this project since it was enjoyable for me to continue and this repo contains only part of the code I've written.
Topics I learned before and during project:
 - Data preprocessing - e.g. Tokenization, Lemmanization, Stemming
 - Working with NLTK package
 - Methods of different text representation and categorization.

## [MAST](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/MAST)  -  April 2020
One of projects made for an Algorithms & Data Structures course during the 2nd semester of my studies.
It's an implementation of a solution for the maximum agreement subtree problem(MAST).
