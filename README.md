# Consolidated-work


## [Messaging app](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/messaging-app)  -  March 2023 - Currently
Putting into practice my theoretical knowledge of backend engineering. 

## [Personal website](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/bulaimaslo.github.io) - March 2023 

## Rust - February 2023 
I've picked up Rust programming language, mostly because to deploying high perfomance application for trading purposes
- [rustlings](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/rustlings)
- [game-of-life](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/game-of-life)
- [rusty-merkle-tree](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/rusty-merkle-tree)
 

## [Write-me-an-email](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/create-me-an-email)  -  December 2022 
Utilizing OpenAI chat GPT to assist me in hard work of writing emails. 

## [Crypto Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/crypto-arb)  -  November 2022
This project is a bot which is be able to find differences between prices of cryptocurrencies on different exchanges and execute trades on them. Using triangular arbitrage strategy to maximize gains. 


## [Online Tutoring](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/ChemApp)  -  August 2022
Web app to organize video tutorials for high school students. Itâ€™s a place for a teacher to
submit their recordings lessons and solutions so students can view them in structured way instead of sharing
links/creating playlists.

## [Web3 Gifs](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/web3gifs)  -  February 2022
App which allows users to submit gifs to the board, have them saved on the Solana blockchain and retrieve all the GIFs that have been submitted. 

## [Chess bot](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/lichess-bot)  -  December 2021
A chess bot compliant with Lichess API so it can compete with other Bots. Designed to beat
most common bots implementation based on minimax algorithm.

## [Maze](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Maze)  -  September 2021
A program that allows you to generate a maze of an arbitrary size, solve it, save it to file and retrieve it.
Usage of Kruskal's algorithm for creation and DFS for solving.

## [Blockchain implementation](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Blockchain)  -  July 2021 
A project which goal is to put my theoretical knowledge about blockchain technologies into practice. It's a simulation of blockchain similar to bitcoin which at the current stage implements:
 - achieving consensus throw Proof of Work mechanism
 - adjusting puzzle difficulty to maintain balanced time of block mining
 - multithread work of the miners

Topics I learned for and during the project:
 - multithreading in Java
 - digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions

## [Recipes](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Recipes)  -  July 2021
Since I studied Data Engineering not computer science I knew I lack some web development knowledge. To catch up I decided to make a web service based on Spring Boot which ended up being a service for handling, storing, deleting, retrieving and updating recipes.  
Topics I learned for and during the project:
 - Spring Boot
 - Gradle
 - REST API
 - H2 Database

## [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/tictactoe)  -  June 2021
After hard time with Python dependencies and ml libraries during previous project I decided to do some work with Java.
I had to revise basics but easily managed to make Tic-tac-toe console game which allows you to play with bots of 3 difficulties:  
 - easy - makes random moves
 - medium - able to find winning move and to block opponent's winning move
 - hard - impossible to win against. With my implementation of the minimax algorithm.

## [NLP](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/NLP)  -  April/May 2021
The goal of this project was comparison of classic text representation methods (bag-of-words and n-grams) with vector representations of words obtained from deep models (word embeddings). Even though I failed to obtain satisfying results from machine learning models I was left with a good portion of knowledge from the nlp domain.  
I abandoned this project since it was enjoyable for me to continue and this repo contains only part of the code I've written.
Topics I learned for and during project:
 - Data preprocessing - e.g. Tokenization, Lemmanization, Stemming
 - Working with NLTK package
 - Methods of different text representation and categorization.

## [MAST](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/MAST)  -  April 2020
One of projects made for an Algorithms & Data Structures course during the 2nd semester of my studies.  
It's an implementation of a solution for the maximum agreement subtree problem(MAST).
