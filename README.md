# Consolidated work

## CryptoWatcher -  Septermber 2024 - Present
Currently developing an app that allows users to subscribe and receive notifications about blockchain events, such as:
- token reaching a specified price
- transactions of a particular blochchain user
- high-value transactions
- minting of new tokens
- viewing statistics of a given blochchain address, trades and profitability

_Mobile: Swift, Swift UI,_ <br>
_Backend: Firebase cloud funtions, Typescript, Google Cloud Firestore db_

## Cookbook -  April - August 2024
I developed a mobile app for organizing cooking recipes.
The motivation was looking at how I used store recipes that is screenshots, random notes. <br>
I created a designated service that extracts recipes data from most websites making it easy to import recipes.<br>

[See it in action here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GZsPY9dp7_c)<br> 

Successfully published it on the [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/cookbook-recipe-organizer/id6615062069), Currently with stunning 100+ downloads!<br> 
<br>
Learned about mobile development, ads & payments services integration, mobile ux/ui, App Store and Google Play Store submission flow & requirements <br>
<br> 
_Mobile: React Native, Typescript_ <br>
_Backend: Vercel, Flask, Python, Firebase_

## Text editor  -  April 2024
I read some article about how text editors works and I wanted to try to implement some of the functionalities we use on daily basis but don't fully comprehend or appreciate. 
- [text_editor](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/text_editor)
- [rope_implementation](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/rope_implementation)

_Python_


## [Datastore](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/datastore)  -   March 2024
During [Notesnook](https://www.notesnook.pl) development I encountered potential improvements trough caching.
To explore this, I implemented my own Redis-like solution, learning about multi-client communication via TCP and some magic words like socket server, event loop.

_Python_

## [Notesnook](https://www.notesnook.pl)  -  November 2023 - March 2024
Web app to create notes, teaching materials and share it with others.
Learned many things not related to actual development like SEO optimizations, marketing, contacting teachers and finding out about their's specific needs.

_Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind css, PostgreSQL_

## [Messaging app](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/messaging-app)  -  March 2023
Putting into practice my theoretical knowledge of backend engineering. 
Unfortunately, it was abandoned as I shifted focus to learn skills relevant to my new job.

## [Personal website](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/bulaimaslo.github.io) - March 2023 

## Rust - February 2023 
I've picked up Rust programming language, mostly because to deploying high perfomance application for trading purposes
- [rustlings](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/rustlings)
- [game-of-life](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/game-of-life)
- [rusty-merkle-tree](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/rusty-merkle-tree)
 

## [Write-me-an-email](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/create-me-an-email)  -  December 2022 
Utilizing OpenAI chat GPT to assist me in hard work of writing emails. 

## [Crypto Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/crypto-arb)  -  November 2022
This project is a bot which is be able to find differences between prices of cryptocurrencies on different exchanges and execute trades on them. Using triangular arbitrage strategy to maximize gains. 

## [Online Tutoring](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/ChemApp)  -  August 2022
Web app to organize video tutorials for high school students. It’s a place for a teacher to
submit their recordings lessons and solutions so students can view them in structured way instead of sharing
links/creating playlists.

## [Web3 Gifs](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/web3gifs)  -  February 2022
App which allows users to submit gifs to the board, have them saved on the Solana blockchain and retrieve all the GIFs that have been submitted. 

## [Chess bot](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/lichess-bot)  -  December 2021
A chess bot compliant with Lichess API so it can compete with other Bots. Designed to beat
most common bots implementation based on minimax algorithm.

## [Maze](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Maze)  -  September 2021
A program that allows you to generate a maze of an arbitrary size, solve it, save it to file and retrieve it.
Usage of Kruskal's algorithm for creation and DFS for solving.

## [Blockchain implementation](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Blockchain)  -  July 2021 
A project which goal is to put my theoretical knowledge about blockchain technologies into practice. It's a simulation of blockchain similar to bitcoin which at the current stage implements:
 - achieving consensus throw Proof of Work mechanism
 - adjusting puzzle difficulty to maintain balanced time of block mining
 - multithread work of the miners

Topics I learned for and during the project:
 - multithreading in Java
 - digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions

## [Recipes](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/Recipes)  -  July 2021
Since I studied Data Engineering not computer science I knew I lack some web development knowledge. To catch up I decided to make a web service based on Spring Boot which ended up being a service for handling, storing, deleting, retrieving and updating recipes.  
Topics I learned for and during the project:
 - Spring Boot
 - Gradle
 - REST API
 - H2 Database

## [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/tictactoe)  -  June 2021
After hard time with Python dependencies and ml libraries during previous project I decided to do some work with Java.
I had to revise basics but easily managed to make Tic-tac-toe console game which allows you to play with bots of 3 difficulties:  
 - easy - makes random moves
 - medium - able to find winning move and to block opponent's winning move
 - hard - impossible to win against. With my implementation of the minimax algorithm.

## [NLP](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/NLP)  -  April/May 2021
The goal of this project was comparison of classic text representation methods (bag-of-words and n-grams) with vector representations of words obtained from deep models (word embeddings). Even though I failed to obtain satisfying results from machine learning models I was left with a good portion of knowledge from the nlp domain.  
I abandoned this project since it was enjoyable for me to continue and this repo contains only part of the code I've written.
Topics I learned for and during project:
 - Data preprocessing - e.g. Tokenization, Lemmanization, Stemming
 - Working with NLTK package
 - Methods of different text representation and categorization.

## [MAST](https://github.com/bulaimaslo/MAST)  -  April 2020
One of projects made for an Algorithms & Data Structures course during the 2nd semester of my studies.  
It's an implementation of a solution for the maximum agreement subtree problem(MAST).
